        Seinfeld is an American television sitcom that originally aired on NBC
        from July 5, 1989, to May 14, 1998. It lasted nine seasons, and is now
        in syndication. It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the
        latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly
        in an apartment block in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City,
        the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances,
        particularly best friend George Costanza, former girlfriend Elaine
        Benes, and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer.
