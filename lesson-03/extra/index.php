        Blended families are becoming more common as people increasingly get
        divorced and remarried. This Swedish drama explores the complexities of
        relationships when two families come together as one. When Lisa and
        Patrik, who both have children with their exes, get married difficulties
        arise with everyone living together under one roof. The new family
        dynamic sometimes leads to problems with what should be a typical task,
        such as throwing a joint birthday party for their two sons. And then
        there are the exes, who remain in Lisa and Patrik's life.
